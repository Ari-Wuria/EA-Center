# EA Center
This is a version 2 of BCIS EA Manager.

It is currently under development. Any suggestion would be welcomed.

The second version of EA Center aims to make student's life at BCIS easier with not only managing EA, but also other things. The current version is located [here](http://tenic.xyz).
